# Kunskapskontroll1--Muhannad-Abbasi

A simple webpage that contains some simple functions, for example:

1 - When you click on the "buy" button under the black hoodie, it will change the button color from gray to red plus it will remove the Social media's list from the page.

2 - When you click on the "buy" button under the red hoodie, it will change the hoodie's background-color plus it will change the text description from a random lorem to a cool text description.

3 - When you click on the "buy" button under the blue hoodie, it will change the hoodie's color from blue to green.

4 - When you click on the "Reset" button on the top right of the page, it will automatically reset all the changes that you've done, and it will remove the list ( Google, Snapchat ... ) that we've added at the beginning of the page
